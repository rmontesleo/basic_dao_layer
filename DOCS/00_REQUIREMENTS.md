This is a python project that connects with a sqlite3 database. We need

1. Python 3 installed in your computer.
```
python3 --version
```

2. Verify you have pip3. This is a package manager to install additional dependencies.
```
pip3 --version
```

3. Install pipenv to create an virtual environment and keep the dependencies isolated from the rest of the system.

```
pip3 install pipenv
```

4. Verify pipenv is installed in your system
```
pipenv --version
```

5. The dependency of python-dotenv to read environment variables in our system. How to install python-dotenv is explaind in the file 01_INSTALL_PROJECT 

6. sqlite3, the database required for this project. How to install is explain in the file 02_INSTALL_DB

7. A text editor or IDE. I worked with VS Code, but you can work with the tool of your preference.
